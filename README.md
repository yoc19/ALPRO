# ALPRO
Just a personal project for Algorithm class, I made this project when I was in first semester.
The Project was to made use of Python turtle, so I made a small platformer game where you can collect points and go on to the next level.
You can move the "character" with "A" or "D" keys and you can press "Space" key to jump.
